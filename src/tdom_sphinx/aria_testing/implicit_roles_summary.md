# Implicit ARIA Roles Testing Summary

The `implicit_roles_test.py` file demonstrates comprehensive testing of implicit ARIA roles in realistic document
structures using the `aria_testing` library. Here's what these tests showcase:

## Test Coverage

### Guidelines

- **Type friendly**: Try to use the `get_` flavors of the queries. These will throw an exception if no node is found.
  This is good, because your tests won't have type hint errors, trying to access a value on something that might be a
  `None`.

### 1. **Document Structure Testing** (`TestImplicitRoles`)

- **Navigation**: Finding `<nav>` elements by their implicit `navigation` role
- **Main Content**: Locating `<main>` elements by their implicit `main` role
- **Banner**: Finding `<header>` elements by their implicit `banner` role
- **Content Info**: Locating `<footer>` elements by their implicit `contentinfo` role
- **Complementary**: Finding `<aside>` elements by their implicit `complementary` role
- **Heading Hierarchy**: Testing all heading elements (`h1-h6`) by their implicit `heading` role
- **Links**: Finding `<a>` elements by their implicit `link` role
- **Lists**: Testing `<ul>/<ol>` elements by their implicit `list` role
- **List Items**: Finding `<li>` elements by their implicit `listitem` role

### 2. **Form Element Testing** (`TestFormImplicitRoles`)

- **Form Container**: Finding `<form>` elements by their implicit `form` role
- **Text Inputs**: Testing various input types (`text`, `email`, `password`) by their `textbox` role
- **Number Inputs**: Finding `input[type="number"]` by their `spinbutton` role
- **Checkboxes**: Testing `input[type="checkbox"]` by their `checkbox` role
- **Radio Buttons**: Finding `input[type="radio"]` by their `radio` role
- **Buttons**: Testing `<button>` elements and `input[type="button/submit/reset"]` by their `button` role

### 3. **Complex Document Queries** (`TestComplexDocumentQueries`)

- **Scoped Searches**: Finding elements within specific containers (navigation links, sidebar content)
- **Contextual Distinction**: Separating main content from sidebar headings
- **Nested Structures**: Testing complex nested list and navigation structures
- **Document Landmarks**: Verifying proper landmark role distribution

### 4. **Advanced Role Interactions** (`TestFormRoleInteractions`, `TestInteractiveElements`)

- **Form Control Types**: Distinguishing between different form control roles within forms
- **Button Variations**: Testing different button implementations (elements vs inputs)
- **Interactive Elements**: Finding all interactive elements across document types
- **Semantic Sections**: Testing semantic HTML5 sectioning elements

## Key Testing Patterns Demonstrated

### 1. **Implicit Role Recognition**

```python
# Finding navigation by implicit role
nav = get_by_role(document, "navigation")
assert nav.tag == "nav"

# Finding headings by level
h1 = get_by_role(document, "heading", level=1)
assert h1.tag == "h1"
```

### 2. **Scoped Searches**

```python
# Find navigation first, then links within it
nav = get_by_role(document, "navigation")
nav_links = get_all_by_role(nav, "link")
```

### 3. **Form Control Testing**

```python
# Find form, then specific control types within it
form = get_by_role(document, "form")
textboxes = get_all_by_role(form, "textbox")
buttons = get_all_by_role(form, "button")
```

### 4. **Document Structure Validation**

```python
# Ensure proper landmark structure
assert len(query_all_by_role(document, "banner")) == 1
assert len(query_all_by_role(document, "main")) == 1
assert len(query_all_by_role(document, "navigation")) == 1
```

## Realistic Test Documents

### 1. **Blog Post Document**

A complete blog post structure with:

- Header with navigation
- Main content with article and headings
- Sidebar with related links
- Footer with copyright

### 2. **Registration Form**

A comprehensive form including:

- Various input types (text, email, password, number)
- Form controls (checkbox, radio buttons)
- Multiple button types (submit, reset, button)
- Proper labeling and fieldsets

## Benefits of This Testing Approach

1. **Accessibility-First**: Tests focus on how screen readers and assistive technology would interact with the content
2. **Semantic HTML**: Validates proper use of semantic HTML elements and their implicit roles
3. **Real-World Scenarios**: Tests use realistic document structures that mirror actual web applications
4. **Role Verification**: Ensures elements have the expected implicit ARIA roles
5. **Scoped Queries**: Demonstrates how to search within specific document sections
6. **Form Testing**: Comprehensive testing of form accessibility patterns

## Test Results

All 30 tests pass, demonstrating:

- Correct implicit role assignment for HTML elements
- Proper hierarchical searching (finding elements within containers)
- Accurate form control role recognition
- Reliable document structure validation

This testing suite serves as both validation of the `aria_testing` library and a demonstration of best practices for
accessibility-focused testing using implicit ARIA roles.
